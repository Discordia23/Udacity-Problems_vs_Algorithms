Problem 2 – File Recursion
Description
The code for the File Recursion problem is based on a recursion call. The functions arguments
are the suffix (extension of a file) and the path where we search for the suffix. First, we iterate 
through all items in the main path (argument) and search for files with the correct suffix. Then 
the recursion call is made for all subdirectories in the current path until all nested directories are searched.

Time Complexity
The time complexity is depending on the items (files and directories) found in the argument’s path. 
As we iterate through each file and check all nested directories, the complexity is O(n) where n is the sum of files and directories.

Space Complexity
O(n) where n is the number of files.
