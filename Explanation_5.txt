Problem 5 – Blockchain

Description
The code for the Blockchain problem is based on a linked list with two pointers (head, tail). 
This allows to append a new block immediately, without traversing the chain. Each new block 
contains a hash from the previous block which is computed in the Block() class.

Time Complexity
The time complexity for appending a node (block) is constant because the tail of the blockchain
 is immediately accessible: O(1).

Space Complexity
O(n) where n is the number of blocks.
