Problem 4 – Active directory

Description
The code for the active directory problem is based on a recursion call. The functions arguments 
are the searched user and the group in which we have to search. As the class Group() allows to 
add both users and groups to a given group, we have to iterate through all items in the main group 
(argument) and search for the user. Then the recursion call is made for all subgroups belonging 
to the arguments group until all subgroups are searched.

Time Complexity
The time complexity increases linearly, depending on the number of subgroups existing. So we are 
expecting a complexity of O(n) where n is the sum of groups and their subgroups.

Space Complexity
Like time complexity O(n).
